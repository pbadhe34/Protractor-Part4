For Fedora, RedHat, CentOS and alike, any customization should be done within /etc/sysconfig/jenkins instead of /etc/init.d/jenkins. The purpose of the first file is exactly the customization of the second file.

So, within /etc/sysconfig/jenkins, there is a the JENKINS_PORT variable that holds the port number on which Jenkins is running.


IN Ubuntu 14.4/Linux   change the file /etc/default/jenkins

E.g.

   #HTTP_PORT=8080
   HTTP_PORT=8083



Add the following two lines after DAEMON_ARGS in the file /etc/init.d/jenkins

HTTP_PORT=8010
JENKINS_ARGS="--httpPort=$HTTP_PORT"


and restart the service

    service jenkins restart
